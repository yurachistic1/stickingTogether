## Sticking Together
Following repository contains code for a small [online store]() selling stickers for charity. The project is no longer active so I decided to disable purchasing and un-private the repository. 

This website was made to facilitate orders, rather than taking them through Instagram IMs. It was also a good opportunity for me to complete a more serious web project using Django, JS, HTML, CSS and as bonus not have to pay for a service like shopify to power the online store.
